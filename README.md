Random Song Selector
This web application selects two random songs from a database of 5,000 songs sourced from Spotify and presents them to users. Our aim is to help music enthusiasts discover new songs and explore different genres of music.

How it works
The application uses a basic array of 5,000 songs id, selects 5 random songs, and presents them to the user. Users can listen to the songs directly on Spotify by clicking the links provided.
